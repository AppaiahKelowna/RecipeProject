## Overview

A React app where users enter available ingredients, and AI generates recipe ideas. Built using React state, controlled inputs, and dynamic UI rendering with API integration.

## What I Learned

- State initialization with useState
- Functional updates and callback syntax
- Controlled inputs and form management
- Abstracted logic for handling multiple input fields
- Implementing CRUD operations on array state
- Parent â†” Child data flow patterns

## Features

- Controlled form elements (text, checkboxes)
- Dynamic list with add/edit/remove
- State lifting and callbacks

## Usage

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Tech Used

- React (functional components & hooks)
- CSS for styling
- Deployed with Netlify

## Future Improvements

- Form validation
- UI enhancements
